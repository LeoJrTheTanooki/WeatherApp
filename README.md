## PEER REVIEW by zachdressing
Page is beautiful, the animated background is very fun!
Dropdowns on forecast are great! the animation is smooth and looks good.
The location text needs to have an if statement to check for and grab the state instead of just country
Size of the page should be bigger to match the figma
Page is very laggy, in part due to lots of console logging of data as well as a lot of string use
Overall very good, but could def use some work in a few places, especially to improve performance.

## Note from developer
Was able to at least comment out console logs, still needs improvements in other areas.
